# papaparse-min

Mirror of the [papaparse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparse) package that only contains the minified JavaScript file. That is, without any unnecessary files such as documentation and unit tests. It is good to have those resources available but they're a complete waste of space in a production environment and inflate the package's size. This has been published as a separate package by [@tjohnston-softdev](https://github.com/tjohnston-softdev) for those who only need the minified code but still want to keep their dependencies organized.

# Disclaimer

This repository is a mirror of the [papaparse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparse) package for Node JS. It mirrors all versions from 4.0.0 onwards since this is when the package was first published to NPM. The reason this is a completely separate repository and not a fork is to keep the repository as small as possible without any unnecessary files. The original work is licensed under MIT and as such, I claim no personal copyright over this publication. All credit should go to the original developers ([@mholt](https://github.com/mholt), [@pokoli](https://github.com/pokoli), et al.)

This is not an official project. I have never directly worked on the 'papaparse' library and I am in no way affiliated with [@mholt](https://github.com/mholt), [@pokoli](https://github.com/pokoli), or any of their respective contributors. This is only a mirror of a package across different versions which have been published to NPM. I will not be actively maintaining the code itself but I will publish mirrors of new versions as they are released.
